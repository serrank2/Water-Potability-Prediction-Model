# Water-Potability-Prediction-Model
This Python Jupyter notebook determines the most important factors in which water is safe enough for consumption.

By buiding classification models, the purpose is to accurately classify water samples as either potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable (unsafe for drinking) based on various water quality parameters such as pH, hardiness, turbidity, etc.
